I am an assistant professor in the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab at the Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam. My research interests include approximate statistical inference, causality and artificial intelligence as well as their application to the life sciences.

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering in Jan. 2019 from Linköping University, advised by Fredrik Lindsten and Thomas Schön. During my PhD studies I visited David Blei at Columbia University, as a Fulbright Visiting Student Researcher, and Frank Wood at the University of Oxford.
